# Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Nanodegree-Program
Apply predictive analytics and business intelligence to solve real-world business problems

## Projects
* **Predict Sales for a Catalog Launch:**

A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. We will apply a framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.

* **Create an Analytical Dataset:**

A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. We will use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.

* **Predict Loan Default Risk:**

A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. We will build and apply a classification model to provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.

* **A/B Test a Menu Launch:**

A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. We will design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.

* **Combine Predictive Techniques:**

A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. We will use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on where and how to expand. After completing the project, you will feel comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering solutions to complex business problems.
